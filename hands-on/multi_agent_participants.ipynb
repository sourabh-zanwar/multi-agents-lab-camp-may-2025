    "   - Restaurant recommendation agent with database and web search capabilities\n",
    "   - Weather information agent integrated with the OpenWeatherMap API\n",
    "   - Event discovery agent that can find activities in any city\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Basic supervisor that routes requests to specialists\n",
    "   - Advanced supervisor that includes detailed task descriptions\n",

    "## 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🎯 **Specialization**: By creating focused agents with specific skills, each one can be optimized for its domain\n",
    "- 🔗 **Coordination**: A supervisor can intelligently route tasks to the right specialist\n",

    "After you complete your tasks, compare with fellow participants to see different approaches. There's often more than one way to architect a multi-agent system!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help - building these systems involves many moving parts and sometimes a fresh perspective helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Key Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-agent systems allow for task specialization and division of labor\n",
    "- The supervisor pattern lets us route tasks intelligently\n",
    "- Tools give agents capabilities beyond simple text generation\n",
    "- Breaking down complex tasks into subtasks makes problems more manageable\n",
    "- Agent coordination requires thoughtful design of communication patterns\n",
