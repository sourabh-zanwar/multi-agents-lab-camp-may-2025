    "1. Work with the restaurant, weather, and events agents to create a coherent day plan\n",
    "2. Incorporate all the information into a single, well-structured itinerary\n",

    "## 📝 Key Learning Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-agent systems allow for task specialization and division of labor\n",
    "- The supervisor pattern lets us route tasks intelligently\n",
    "- Tools give agents capabilities beyond simple text generation\n",
    "- Breaking down complex tasks into subtasks makes problems more manageable\n",
    "- Agent coordination requires thoughtful design of communication patterns\n",
